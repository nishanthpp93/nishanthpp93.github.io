                                    <p><b><i>Authors</i></b>: Abhijit Bhattacharya, Akhila Rao, K. P. Naveen, Nishanth P. P., S. V. R. Anand and <a href="http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/~anurag/index.htm" target="_blank">Anurag Kumar</a> (Director, <a href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore</a>).<br><br>
                                    <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> Given a set of sensors at pre-determined locations, a set of potential locations for placing base stations (BS, or sinks), and another set of potential locations for placing wireless relay nodes, in which each location for a BS and a relay is associated with a cost, we consider the problem of selecting a set of BS locations, a set of relay locations, and an association of sensor nodes with the chosen BS locations, such that the number of hops in the path from each sensor to the corresponding BS is bounded by h<sub>max</sub>, and among all such feasible networks, determine the network associated with the minimum total cost. The hop count bound suffices to ensure a certain probability of the data being delivered to the BS within a given maximum delay under a light traffic model. We observe that the problem is NP-Hard, and is hard to even approximate within a constant factor. We propose a polynomial time approximation algorithm (SmartSelect) based on a relay placement algorithm proposed in our earlier work, along with a modification of the greedy algorithm for weighted set cover. We have analyzed the worst case approximation guarantee for this algorithm. We have also proposed a polynomial time heuristic to improve upon the solution provided by SmartSelect. Our numerical results demonstrate that the algorithms provide good quality solutions using very little computation time in various randomly generated network scenarios.

                                    <p>The problem was to optimally choose positions for sinks and relays from a pool of potential sink locations and potential relay locations, given a set of sensor locations, such that the hop count from any source to any sink is bounded by an upper limit, and, in addition to this, find the minimum cost among all such feasible networks. <br>
                                    We proposed a polynomial time approximation algorithm (SmartSelect) based on a relay placement algorithm proposed in our earlier work, along with a modification of the greedy algorithm for weighted set cover. <br>
                                    We also came up with a polynomial time heuristic algorithm that improved upon the solution obtained by the aforementioned one, by pruning each sink from its solution set and running the whole algorithm repeatedly over the remaining sinks until there was no improvement in cost or the user-set iteration limit was reached.</p>

                                    <p>Implemented an object tracking algorithm using adaptive background subtraction techniques in MATLAB and achieved perfect results when benchmarked against Advanced Video and Signal-based Surveillance, 2007, and Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance, 2006, and 2007 datasets. Background subtraction here proved to be more challenging since lighting conditions kept changing during the daytime and necessitated the requirement of a dynamically-adaptive background. Implemented an algorithm to morph static parts of consecutive images and replace parts of the background when it encountered consecutive frames with a foreground blob area larger than a certain threshold. Reduced the number of false positives by allowing the background to adapt to different lighting conditions, as opposed to a static background, and hence warranted robustness.</p>

                                    <p>Implemented an algorithm to perform background subtraction and object tracking by using selective sampling and combining multiple consecutive sampled frames to reduce noise and detect the abandoned objects even under occlusion by other moving foreground parts. Designed it to show a warning sign around the potential abandoned objects thus detected in order to assist security in detecting them. Achieved perfect results when benchmarked against Advanced Video and Signal-based Surveillance, 2007, and Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance, 2006, and 2007 datasets.</p>
